          My name is Mark, I have a background in sales, account management, and leadership, but technology and video games have always been my passion. Leading me to want to learn how to code to pursue my dream of publishing a game for iOS. Web development and creating a game from JavaScript will be the first step.

          In my spare time, I love to go fishing, reading, reading while fishing! Recently, I have decided to take fishing to another level, with kayak fishing! Can't afford a boat, nor do I have room to store a boat, but my inflatable kayak fits snugly in a hidden compartment in the trunk of my Toyota Rav4. Other hobbies of mine are watching: NFL, where the Broncos are my team! I also enjoy watching the NBA, as well as NHL. Anime's and PC games, such as Civilization round out my spare time.
